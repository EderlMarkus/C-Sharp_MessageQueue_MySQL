# People with Superpowers

## Message Queue and MySQL Connection with C

Little Side-Project with C#.
Basically just playing around, creating Objects (in this case Persons with Superpowers and Age), then having 2 console applications, one Provider that creates and adds Objects to a Message-Queue and saves them in a MySQL-Database, and one Consumer that reads the Queue.

Thats basically it, just for reference, if I ever need one of those things in the future again.
